#alexWEBsoft - portfolio site v.2.0
This site is a 2nd version of my portfolio... It is made with lot of .php code with mysqli queries. Every data is in mysql tables, except the "About me"...

Main menu is in sql table called pages, portfolio section is also in sql table called portfolio. Main menu call pages with id number, so main menu will automatically change if I add some more data in table.

Social links are also written in sql table called social, so if I want to add some new features with social links, it only takes to add some more data to the table.

This site has no admin backend at this moment, but I will provide it.
